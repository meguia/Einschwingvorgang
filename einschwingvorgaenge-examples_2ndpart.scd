1.1. The simplest case (pure tone).

Working in a circular phase space.

The following examples help to understand dynamical systems on a circle.
If everything is in a circle, we can describe every point by a single number: the angle
The angle, we call it theta here, goes from 0 to 2pi (360Â°), which is the same again as 0.
So we can continue forever while staying in a limited range.

To know the vertical (y) position of a point in a circle, relative to a coordinate system,
we use the function sin(theta). For the horizontal position, cos(theta)
